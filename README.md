<h1>Snake Game in Javascript</h1>
This is a simple Snake Game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be played both on a PC using keyboard arrow keys and on a mobile device using touch-based arrow buttons. The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own tail. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.

<h3>How to Play</h3>
To play the game, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement. On mobile devices, use the touch-based arrow buttons to control the snake. The game starts with a single snake segment and an apple on the screen. Move the snake towards the apple to make it grow in length. Each time the snake eats an apple, your score will increase. Be careful not to run into the walls or the snake's own tail, or the game will end. The game also ends if the snake fills the entire screen.
